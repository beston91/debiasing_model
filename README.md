# Debiasing Model 

This is an experimental project extending on [Self-Diagnosis and Self-Debiasing: A Proposal for Reducing Corpus-Base Bias in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00453) that tests the hypothesis that using the output of Schick's de-biasing procedure as labels and fine-tuning the model directly will lead to similar or reduced toxicity scores according to [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/).
